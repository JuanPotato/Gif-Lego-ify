# Legofy [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JuanPotato/Legofy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JuanPotato/Legofy)

### What is it?
Legofy is a python program that takes a static image or gif and makes it so that it looks as if it was created in lego.

<img alt="Before" title="Before" height="500" src="https://github.com/JuanPotato/Legofy/blob/master/tests/image.jpg?raw=true">
<img alt="After" title="After" height="500" src="https://github.com/JuanPotato/Legofy/blob/master/tests/lego_image.png?raw=true">

### Requirements
* Python
* Python modules: Pillow, click
* imagemagick ~(except windows, binary included because reasons)~

### Bugs
* nothing

### TODO
* Make an optional argument to only allow official lego colors

### Examples (it is ok if any of the images are not small, the program automatically shrinks them down)
* Need to make new ones, soon
